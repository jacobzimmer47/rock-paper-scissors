# learning goals
To seperate the data model and the dom. Creating a user friendly app that has correct game logic. Create classes that can be interacted with to display info to the user.

# Wins/Challenegs
I ended up coding two whole games. The first one had bugs and the game logic didnt work. After going through the app w my mentors, I started over to create a working app, that is empathetic  to other devs.
